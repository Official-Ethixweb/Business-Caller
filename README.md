# Business Caller

A simple website where your employee opens a page, types a phone number,
clicks **Call**, and talks to the client through his laptop's microphone —
using your Twilio number `+1 (206) 452-3433` as the caller ID. No SIM card
needed on his end.

This guide assumes you have never used Next.js, Twilio, or Vercel before.
Follow it top to bottom.

## What's already done

- [x] Twilio API Key created ("Business Caller", Standard)
- [x] Twilio TwiML App created ("Business Caller")
- [x] All the application code (this repository)
- [ ] Auth Token added to your local `.env.local`
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel
- [ ] TwiML App's Voice Request URL pointed at the live Vercel URL

## How it works, in plain terms

1. Amar opens the website and types an access code (a password only you and
   he know) to unlock the dialer.
2. He types a client's phone number and clicks **Call**.
3. His browser talks to Twilio directly using the Twilio Voice SDK.
4. Twilio asks *this app's* server ("`/api/voice`") how to handle the call.
   The server checks the request is genuinely from Twilio, checks the
   number is valid, and tells Twilio: "dial this number, show
   +12064523433 as the caller ID."
5. Twilio dials the client. Amar talks through his laptop mic/speakers.

Your existing setup — the Twilio number forwarding incoming calls to
India — is a completely separate configuration and is never touched by
this app.

## 1. Install and configure for local testing

```bash
npm install
```

Open `.env.local` in this project (already partly filled in for you) and
add the one remaining value:

- **`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`** — in the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com),
  go to **Settings → Account settings → Account details & security**, and
  click **View** next to **Auth Token**. Copy it in.

Leave `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` empty for now — you'll fill that in after
deploying (Section 3).

The full, current list of variables and what each one is for is in
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

## 2. Run it locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. You'll see the lock screen — enter the
access code from `APP_ACCESS_CODE` in `.env.local`. You can fully test the
lock screen, the dialer UI, and the microphone prompt this way.

**You cannot place a real call from `localhost`** — Twilio needs to reach
`/api/voice` over the public internet, and your laptop isn't on the public
internet. Real call testing happens after deploying to Vercel (next
section). If you want to test locally anyway, run a tunnel:

```bash
npx ngrok http 3000
```

then set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the `https://...ngrok...` address it gives
you, and temporarily point the TwiML App's Voice Request URL at
`https://...ngrok.../api/voice` (Twilio Console → Voice → Manage → TwiML
Apps → Business Caller). Switch it back to your real Vercel URL once
you've deployed.

## 3. Deploy to Vercel

No config file needed — just:

1. Push this repository to GitHub (already set up as `origin` — see the
   chat for the exact commands used, or run `git push origin main` once
   you're authenticated).
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new), click **Import** next
   to the `Business-Caller` GitHub repo. Vercel auto-detects Next.js —
   don't change any build settings.
3. Before clicking **Deploy**, expand **Environment Variables** and add
   every variable from [`.env.example`](.env.example) with its real value
   (same values as your local `.env.local`, except see step 4 below for
   `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`). Apply them to the **Production** environment at
   minimum.
4. Click **Deploy**. When it finishes, Vercel shows you a URL like
   `https://business-caller-xxxx.vercel.app` (or a cleaner one if you
   assign a custom domain later). Go back into **Project Settings →
   Environment Variables**, set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to that exact URL (no
   trailing slash), and redeploy so it takes effect.

## 4. Point Twilio at the live URL

**Do this only after Vercel is live and `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set to match.**

Twilio Console → **Voice → Manage → TwiML Apps → Business Caller** →
under **Voice Configuration**, set:

- **REQUEST URL**: `https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/voice`
- Method: **HTTP POST**

Click **Save**.

## 5. Test a real call

1. Open the deployed URL, enter the access code, allow the microphone
   prompt.
2. Type a real number you can answer, in international format (e.g.
   `+919876543210` or `+12065551234`), click **Call**.
3. It should ring, and the caller ID should show `+1 (206) 452-3433`.
4. If it doesn't work, check **Twilio Console → Monitor → Logs → Calls**
   and **Errors** for the specific reason — the most common first-time
   issues are the Request URL not matching `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` exactly, or
   the destination country being blocked under **Voice → Settings → Geo
   Permissions**.

## 6. Give Amar the URL

Send Amar two things: the Vercel URL and the access code. That's all he
needs — no installs, no SIM card, just a laptop with a mic and a browser.

## Extra features

- **Microphone / speaker picker** — appears above the phone number field.
  Bluetooth headsets show up automatically once paired with the OS; no
  extra setup.
- **Mute + keypad** — appear once a call connects, for muting and for
  entering digits into an IVR.
- **Phone Book** — contacts are stored server-side in a Twilio Sync
  Document (see `TWILIO_SYNC_SERVICE_SID` below), so the same list shows
  up on every device Amar unlocks the dialer from — add one on a laptop,
  it's there on the phone too.
- **Messages/SMS** — an inbox-style list of every past conversation
  (pulled from Twilio's real message history, most recent first), tap one
  to open the full thread with a back button to return to the list, or
  type a new number to start a fresh conversation. Threads poll
  `/api/messages` every 5 seconds, which reads Twilio's actual Message
  history for that number (Twilio records every inbound and outbound SMS
  on the account automatically, regardless of any webhook), so a client's
  reply shows up on its own — nothing to configure for that part. If a
  number matches a saved contact, their name shows instead of the raw
  number.
- **On desktop**, Messages and Phone Book sit as permanent side panels.
  **On mobile**, tap the ☰ menu (top-left) to open them in a slide-in
  drawer with tabs — full functionality, just tucked away since there's
  no spare screen width.
- **Deleting messages/conversations** — the small trash icon on a
  conversation row or on an individual message deletes it. This calls
  Twilio's own delete on the Message resource, so it's a real, permanent
  removal from Twilio's records (not just hidden in this UI) — there's a
  confirmation prompt first since it can't be undone.
- Sending SMS requires **SMS capability enabled** on `+12064523433` in the
  Twilio Console (Phone Numbers → your number → check the "SMS"
  capability is on) — if it's off, sends fail with a clear error. No
  extra env vars needed; `/api/sms` and `/api/messages` reuse the same
  credentials as everything else.
- **App icon** — a custom icon (a phone glyph on the same near-black/crimson
  brand gradient) is wired up for the browser tab, iOS/Android "Add to
  Home Screen," and Chrome's install prompt. Installed from the home
  screen, it opens full-screen with no browser address bar, like a real
  app.
- **Face ID / Touch ID / Windows Hello** — on a browser and device that
  supports a platform authenticator, the lock screen offers "Unlock with
  Face ID / Touch ID" as an alternative to typing the access code every
  time. This is real WebAuthn (passkey) authentication via
  `@simplewebauthn/server` and `@simplewebauthn/browser` — not a password
  autofill shim:
  - **Setup**: unlock normally with the access code once, then click
    **"+ Add this device"** near the bottom of the dialer card. That
    registers a credential tied to this specific browser/device's secure
    enclave.
  - **After that**: the lock screen shows the Face ID/Touch ID button
    first, with the access code as a fallback below it.
  - **Under the hood**: registering a new credential still requires the
    real access code (so a stranger who finds the URL can't register
    their own face as a backdoor). Signing in with a registered
    credential does not — the verified biometric signature itself is the
    proof, and on success the server hands back the real access code,
    which the app then uses exactly as if it had been typed.
  - **Managing devices**: the same "Face ID / Touch ID" section lists every
    registered device with a remove button, in case a device is lost or
    no longer used.
  - Credentials are stored in the same Twilio Sync Service as the Phone
    Book (a new document, `webauthn_credentials`) — no new env vars.

### Heads up: Twilio's default SMS auto-reply

Your number currently has **no messaging webhook configured**, so Twilio
auto-sends its generic fallback reply ("Thanks for the message... Reply
HELP for help...") to every inbound text — this happens outside of and
regardless of this app. If you don't want clients receiving that canned
reply, go to Twilio Console → **Phone Numbers → your number → Messaging**
and either point the "A message comes in" webhook at a URL that returns
empty TwiML, or clear whatever's causing the fallback. This app doesn't
touch that setting — it wasn't asked to — but it's worth knowing about
since it's live right now.

## Architecture

```
Browser (Amar, in the US)
  -> Twilio Voice JS SDK (@twilio/voice-sdk)
  -> POST /api/token          (mints a short-lived Twilio Access Token)
  -> Twilio Voice edge, using that Access Token
  -> TwiML App "Voice Request URL"
  -> POST /api/voice           (verifies the request, returns <Dial>)
  -> Twilio Voice
  -> destination phone number
```

`/api/voice` never trusts the browser: it verifies the `X-Twilio-Signature`
header on every request (so only Twilio itself can trigger a dial), checks
the caller's identity matches what this app issues, and re-validates the
destination number is in E.164 format before generating TwiML.
